A full-stack Employee Management System (EMS) built with Spring Boot 3 (backend) and React + Vite (frontend), using MySQL as the database. The system supports three roles — Admin, Manager, and Employee — each with different levels of access. Features include employee profile management, department and designation management, task assignment with deadlines and priority levels, resignation workflow with notice period tracking, announcements, manager notes, and a full audit log. Authentication is handled via JWT with refresh token support. The API is documented with Swagger UI.
